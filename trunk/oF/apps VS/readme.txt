For this to work you need to add a reference to the VVVV Utils
in your project.

Instructions on how to do that:

1. Add the Utils project to your solution (look for _Utils on the VVVV
SVN. If you've written any plugins then chances are that you have this
already).

2. Right click on your Visual Studio project

	'Add New Reference...'
	'Projects' (tab)
	Choose Utils
	
	I also added the path to Utils project in my
	'Additional reference search paths'
